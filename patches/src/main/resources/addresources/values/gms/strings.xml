<!--

    Strings with new lines must be raw strings where they're wrapped in quotes and new lines are not encoded.
    Raw strings still requires escaping embedded double quotes but escaping embedded single quotes is optional.

    Raw strings are required because Crowdin AI translations regularly gets confused and
    replace \n with an encoded new line character.

    Bad:
        <string name="summary_key">First \'item\' text\nSecond \"item\" text</string>

    Good:
        <string name="summary_key">"First 'item' text
Second \"item\" text"</string>
